# NdFeB Wiki

Welcome on my personal wiki! You can find all kind of information here. I add articles when i come across interesting information while working on different projects or resolving root-me challenges. It also serves me as a repository of relevant search results.

This wiki is semi-public: people can see what I write, but cannot modify it. Feel free to create a pull request on [github](https://github.com/NeodymiumFerBore/wiki-pages)!

When I use information from other websites, articles are ended with a **Sources** section where you can find the original articles. All credit to the author.
